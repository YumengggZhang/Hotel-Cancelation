# Hotel Cancellation Rate Prediction Project
This project focuses on addressing missing data, data cleaning, and exploratory data analysis for hotel booking information to predict cancellation rates. We tackle challenges such as handling missing values in key columns like 'children' and 'country', and we address fields with high missing rates such as 'company' and 'agent'. Special preprocessing ensures that occupancy counts are logical, and outliers in daily rates are identified. Through comprehensive exploratory data analysis, we compare customer cancellation rates and identify geographical patterns in bookings, with a particular emphasis on European countries. The outcome is a robust data processing pipeline that facilitates the development of predictive models for hotel cancellation rates.
